COPYING FILES (INCLUDING HIDDEN FILES)
	If you want to just copy, you can use a mere:

	cp -r /path/subfolder/. /path/
	#                     ^
	#                     note the dot!
	This will copy all files, both normal and hidden ones, since /path/subfolder/. expands to "everything from this directory" (Source: How to copy with cp to include hidden files and hidden directories and their contents?)

	cp -a path/de/origem path/de/destino
		* a općão -a permite preservar todos os atributos dos arquivos
